# 🌌 Universe

**Literally a simulation of the universe.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Universe** is a powerful simulation software that models a virtual universe. It is designed to be both expansive and interactive, allowing users to explore and manipulate cosmic environments through a set of predefined commands.

> ⚠️ **Memory Requirement**: To run Universe efficiently, please ensure your system has at least **50GB of RAM** available.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

The core of the simulation is managed by the `Universe.py` file. This script is responsible for:

- Creating the universe simulation
- Launching the gRPC server to enable remote interactions

There is **no need to reload or regenerate** the universe at each startup — the simulation persists across sessions.

---

## 🧭 Navigation

Universe includes a set of commands that allow users to navigate and interact with the simulated universe. These commands are documented in a separate file for clarity and modularity.
